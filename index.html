                    <h3>Backdoor & RCE Tool</h3>
                    <p>Post exploit web backdoor I was tasked with creating while at Colsa. It had the ability to execute commands remotely, view
                        the victims webcam, upload files to the victims computer, extract files from the victims computer, move the victims mouse,
                        and take screenshots of the victims screen(s).
                    </p>
                    <p>Sadly I cannot show the code for this project as I was asked to keep it confidential since it was work I had done for Colsa.</p>
