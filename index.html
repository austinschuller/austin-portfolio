            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Backdoor & RCE Tool</h3>
            <p>Info: During my time as a co-op at Colsa Corporation I was tasked with leading a project on developing a post exploit
                tool that would allow a threat actor to take full control over a system. This tool has the ability to traverse the system,
                view the victims webcam, upload files/scripts to the victims system, extract the victims files, and remotely execute commands.
            </p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/austinschuller/VirusTotal-V3-API-Project">VirusTotal API CLI Tool</a></h3>
            <p>Info: When I started learning how to use API's I decided to make a CLI tool that allows the user to scan URLs and Files using
                the VirusTotal API.
